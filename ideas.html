        <h2>Building this Site</h2>
        <br>
        <p>We I started building this website, I have little knowledge about HTML and CSS. I was better at JS from former projects involving inter-platform data transmitting. While there are many ready-to-use services like Wix.com and squarespace.com, and Adobe Muse allows you draw the page out, I picked the old name: Dreamweaver. This decision is made for several reasons:</p>
        <li>I want to learn CSS from the bottom to the top.</li>
        <li>I feel more comfortable to able to understand every part of my site, not borrowing templates and widgets from someone else.</li>
        <li>I don’t see this website as simply a portfolio or a for job-finding tool. This website is the place where I respect my team and myself for all the accomplishments we’ve achieved. </li>
        <li>I want all my text, image, shape and color unique from others.</li>
        <li>I wish to keep this site to grow with me, so it should able to withstand the evolution of web design with simple but delightful visual style.</li>
        <p>Therefore, I spent more time in w3schools reading demo code and references than searching for templates. It's not I hate website looking awesome fashionable, but the content is always more important than style to me. Although I have been a designer for many years, I wish to keep the website as the vessel of my thoughts and words, here is what I did.</p>
        <li>Except three paragraphs of descriptions are based on our old team report, I wrote all the project discerptions.</li>
        <li>Every the pictures are made either by my friends or me.</li>
        <li>All the HTML handwritten, checked and optimized.</li>
        <li>Unique CSS style with self-defined color theme other settings.</li>
        <li>I became hell good at reading HTML in Dreamweaver.</li>

        <h2>How to Solve the Problem of 11-foot-8 Bridge</h2>
        <br>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/ideas/Durham--Gregson_Street_Guillotine_01.jpg">
        <h3>The “Can Opener”</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11_foot_8_Bridge">11 foot 8 Bridge</a> is a railroad overpass in Durham, North Carolina, USA. The 11 feet 8 inches clearance makes it 2 feet lower than average height of semi-truck trailer. Although it’s not the lowest bridge in the States, a YouTuber named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yovo68">Jürgen Henn</a> started posting truck crash video of this bridge recorded from his webcam from 2008 and made this bridge famous among the internet. Based on the Wikipedia discerption, the bridge can’t be raised since rising a railroad bridge cost too much, and the street can’t be lowered because a sewer runs closely under it. This awkward situation leads to thousands of trucks lost their roofs, and gives this bridge a nickname: “The Can Opener”.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Luckily, the city installed a new warning system to notify any trucks taller than 11’8” with a sign of “Overnight Must Turn” and extra red light time. It indeed lower the rate of trucks hitting the H-beam steel protecting the bridge, but every now and then there are new victims coming. Just like this following video shows.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Let’s stop questioning the effeteness of government works, the story of this bridge makes a wonderful thought exercise of fixing real-life usability problem. The bridge is not a software program, but like many computer system, some UX problems are currently impossible to find a total cure due to many limitations. How do you temporarily alter the design to stop frustrating fresh users (or chop more roofs)?</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Problem defined</h3>
		  <li>The clearance of the bridge is not the only reason causing this chaos, if you observe those crash carefully from the video. Here are some others.</li>
		  <li>Many vehicles hit the H-beam are rental trucks and RVs. These drivers don't know the terrain as well as local drivers. </li>
		  <li>The intersection by the side is very close to the bridge that turning vehicles might don’t have reaction time to read the sign before they try to stop.</li>
		  <li>Unlike some other tunnels, this overpass looks wide and spacious, which doesn’t raise the alarm for drivers to be careful. </li>
		  <li>If every bridge has yellow colored height warning, chances are human brains will just ignore the same kind of waring there.</li>
        <h3>Error Prevention system</h3>
        <p>Blaming careless truck driver like many comments under the video is easy, but won’t help solving the problem until every US truck driver had heard of this bridge.</p>
        <h3>Solutions</h3>
