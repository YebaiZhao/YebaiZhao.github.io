            <h3>The “Can Opener”</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11_foot_8_Bridge">11 foot 8 Bridge</a> is a railroad overpass in Durham, North Carolina, USA. The 11 feet 8 inches clearance makes it 2 feet lower than average height of semi-truck trailer. Although it’s not the lowest bridge in the States, a YouTuber named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yovo68">Jürgen Henn</a> started posting truck crash video of this bridge recorded from his webcam from 2008 and made this bridge famous among the internet. Based on the Wikipedia discerption, the bridge can’t be raised since rising a railroad bridge cost too much, and the street can’t be lowered because a sewer runs closely under it. This awkward situation leads to thousands of trucks lost their roofs, and gives this bridge a nickname: “The Can Opener”.</p>

            <p>Luckily, the city installed a new warning system to notify any trucks taller than 11’8” with a sign of “Overheight Must Turn” and extra red light time. It indeed lower the rate of trucks hitting the H-beam steel protecting the bridge, but every now and then there are new victims coming. Just like this following video shows.</p>

            <p>Let’s stop questioning the effeteness of government works, the story of this bridge makes a wonderful thought exercise of fixing real-life usability problem. The bridge is not a software program, but like many computer system, some UX problems are currently impossible to find a total cure due to many limitations. How do you temporarily alter the design to stop frustrating fresh users (or chop more roofs)?</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Problem Defined</h3>
            <li>The clearance of the bridge is not the only reason causing this chaos, if you observe those crash carefully from the video. Here are some others.</li>
            <li>Many vehicles hit the H-beam are rental trucks and RVs. These drivers don't know the terrain as well as local drivers. </li>
            <li>The intersection by the side is very close to the bridge that turning vehicles might don’t have reaction time to read the sign before they try to stop.</li>
            <li>Unlike some other tunnels, this overpass looks wide and spacious, which doesn’t raise the alarm for drivers to be careful. </li>
            <li>If every bridge has yellow colored height warning, chances are human brains will just ignore the same warning there.</li>
            <h3>Error Prevention system</h3>
            <p>Blaming careless truck driver like many comments under the video is easy, but won’t help solving the problem until every US truck driver had heard of this bridge. The bridge won’t be relocated, the height is fixed, the intersection will remain, what can be done?</p>
            <p>The human error usually appears when humans think they are safe, consistent, and everything is in normal condition. If I am a rental truck driver, this bridge looks normal to me since every bridge has yellow height warning signs and my head is far away from hitting the concrete wall. To fundamentally convey the warning message, we need an error prevention system that looks totally different from other bridge, while stays as an organic part of the environment.</p>
