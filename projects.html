    <h2>Project Clock 240</h2>
    <li>Team size: 2</li>
    <li>Time length: 2 months</li>
    <li>Keyword: IoT, smart home, Particle Photon, microcontroller, 3D printing, laser cutting, Web control interface </li>
    <br>
    <p>What will be a clock like in a smart home? Clock240 is a working prototype born from one of our visions. Laptop, tablet, smartphone and smartTV, almost every screen in the house shows the time now. It makes the importance of a wall clock is slowly fading out. To revalue this old friend, our Clock240 smart clock design makes the clock a central display for the family to read different types of information related to the house on a timely manner.</p>
    <p>A microcontroller enables the Clock240 to communicate with other sensors in the house through WiFi. Other sensor modules driven by the same framework can be easily placed in the house with outstanding extensibility. Two hundred and forty blocks moved by micro servo can visualize four types of data in each twelve minutes in the past twelve hours.

      	<h3>Beautiful and Smart</h3>
		<p>The Clock240 prototype is made of over 350 components. Acrylic panels and color blocks, wooden casing, motors, servos, screws, nuts, 3D printing components, wires, switches, connectors and microcontroller, working in a harmony, covered by a simplicity design.

      	<h3>Red, Yellow, Green and Blue</h3>
		<p>Four rings of colored acrylic blocks give users a tangible visualization of four types of data possibly selected from room temperature, light condition, humidity, door opening, power consumption or weather forecast. Each block can be pushed out from 1% to 100% by a servo. A special type of grease holds the blocks while the clock rotates until they are repositioned by four slopes after a circle of twelve hours.  </p>

      	<h3>The Concept</h3>
		<p>After the liquid display project, we have been excited about the idea of using Particle Photon WiFi development board to make a more complicated project with multiple IoT devices fit for future home. We found the wall clock hasn’t been changed for decades by the information revolution. Meanwhile, there is not yet a center place for home members to review what had happened after they return from school, work or other trips. As a cat owner, I am curious about when my cats are more active. When they are alone? In the midnight? In front of me? I believe this creation will help to solve my wonder, as long as other curious questions people have in their house. </p>
		<p>Our team modified the plan several times to fit our capability and time limit. Through the discussion we also ruled out impractical ideas, replaced them with reliable, efficient and beautiful designs. The iteration design and plan revise happened almost every day at the initial stage. </p>

        <h2>EPICENTER</h2>
        <li>Team size: 4 </li>
        <li>Input: interview on 7 first responders, Graphical design guidelines,</li>
        <li>Output: Website prototype, Mobile porotype, User personas, User storyboards </li>
        <li>Length: 3 months</li>
        <br>
        <p>The Epicenter project is an information and interaction design practice. The core objective of our client was to build an efficient, user-friendly training website for first responders. We conducted contextual inquiries to gather detailed user scenario information of target users like fireman, emergency medical technician and ski patroller. Then, we made affinity diagram to group up viable feature points we found from the interview. Based on these design features, we created web and mobile application prototypes for demonstration.</p>

        <div class="squareLeft"> 
          <h3>Contextual Inquiry </h3>
		  <p>The reason of performing the contextual inquiry was not only to understand our users, but also the environment they use the Epicenter. First responders may take their training during work hours, and probably interrupted by alarms, rings and other distractions. Thus, letting them being able to save and resume the training was specially considered in the design.</p>

              <div class="squareRight"> 
              <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
              <p>Contextual inquiries gave us hundreds of comments about how first responders use technology, as well as their anticipation of a modern training website. Our team wrote those features found from the interview down to sticky notes, and carefully organized them into hierarchy.</p>

       	<h3>Personas</h3>
		<p>We created seven user personas based on behavioral patterns we found. These findings also led us to define the persona’s characteristics and goals. Designated scenario stories were given to personas to better describe their personality, ability and duty.</p>

            <div class="squareRight"> 
              	<h3>Design</h3>
				<p>With only primitive website building skills (back then), we made a mockup website prototype on the Wix.com and an iOS application prototype on inVision.com, as the overall demonstration of our user study. In charge of the mobile app prototyping, I spent extra efforts on binding the required features and training content with the lightweight, easy-to-use mobile experience.</p>
